# SPARQL examples template repository

This is a template repository to help you get started with sharing your sparql examples in a structured maner.


The idea comes from the [SIB SPARQL Examples](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples/) project. 

# Upon forking

Change YOUR\_PROJECT to what you need it to be, adapt the index.md files.
Add your prefixes.ttl and examples in \*.ttl files.
Correct the LICSENSE.md and CITATION.cff to account for your project.
